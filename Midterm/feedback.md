# Notes on the Midterm

* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 10
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 10
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 9

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

Overall, nicely done.

You didn't include any docstrings or tests as required. I've only deducted 9 points from the _Docs / Testing_ score, though, because I found your variable names made the code very easy to read on Step 1.

However, it looks like you didn't see a way to approach the rest of assignment. The 




## Step 1
* Your code only works with the `/data/negotiated_rates.json` file rather than any file name passed into the function. Take care not to hardcode things like file names.
* Just a note on convention - when you open a file and then read all the contents in using `json.load(f)`, you can move the rest of your code outside the `with` block.  At that point, Python is done reading from the file and you can let it close the file.

## Step 2
It's unclear to me what your code is trying to do. I can't award any points for this solution and have to deduct 10 from the _Correctness_ total.

## Step 3
It's unclear to me what your code is trying to do. I can't award any points for this solution and have to deduct 10 from the _Correctness_ total.

## Step 4
It's unclear to me what your code is trying to do. I can't award any points for this solution and have to deduct 10 from the _Correctness_ total.
