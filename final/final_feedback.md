# Feedback on Final

Overall, I think you did a good job demonstrating most of the skills we learned this semester. I especially liked your use of probability charts and histograms to understand the data patterns.  That was nice.
1. One of the requirements was to use function to abstract or encapsulate logic. I didn't see that.
2. I'm not clear what value the `transform()` operations you used had. You didn't use that data anywhere did you?

I think you did a good job with most of the requirements, but fell short in data transformations that served a purpose for your project, and in the use of functions to modularize your code.  Some explanations could have been clearer along the way as well.
